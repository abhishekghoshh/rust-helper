# Rust style guide 

#### by Rust lang book
- If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can use an automatic formatter tool called [rustfmt](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html) to format your code in a particular style
- If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use hello_world.rs rather than helloworld.rs.
- Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
